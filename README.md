In developing this restaurant management system, first we started with the project requirements and defined the functionality and design requirements of the system. An object-oriented design pattern was used to decompose the system into different classes, such as User, Material, Dish, Customer, Order, Notification, and Finance. Each class has specific properties and methods to manage the relevant information. The first draft 'z.cpp' was formed.

After that we considered the overall aesthetics of the interface and wanted it to be more logical and user-friendly. Therefore adjustments were made in some interactions. The user registration and login functions were realized. And the add, modify, delete and display functions are displayed in two levels. At the same time, we checked the legitimacy of user input to ensure the robustness and security of the system. This draft is 'GroupWork.cpp'.

Finally, we added comments, fixed some potential bugs, and conducted comprehensive testing to verify the functionality and performance of the system to complete the final draft, i.e. 'code.cpp'.

During the coding process, we followed good software engineering principles, minimized coupling, improved cohesion, and ensured the maintainability and scalability of the code.
End.
